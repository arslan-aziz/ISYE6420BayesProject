## Applying Bayesian Methods in PyMC3 to Predict Flu Incidence
---
### What is this project?
For the final project in my Georgia Tech ISYE 6420 Bayesian Statistics course I was interested in using Bayesian methods for prediction, especially in a time series setting. With my background in biomedical engineering and due to the rich background literature, predicting flu incidence was an interesting problem to pursue.
